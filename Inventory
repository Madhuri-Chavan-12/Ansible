# INVENTORY

An **Ansible inventory file** contains the list of machines that Ansible manages.  
These machines are known as *managed nodes*.

The inventory file tells Ansible:
- Where to run tasks  
- How to connect to systems  
- How to group hosts  
- How to define connection variables  

---

## TYPES OF INVENTORIES

### 1. STATIC INVENTORY

Static inventory is a manually created file where hostnames or IP addresses are written directly.

It is mostly used for:
- Small setups  
- Practice environments  
- Systems where servers rarely change  

Static inventory files are commonly written in:
- **INI format**
- **YAML format**

---

### STATIC INVENTORY – INI FORMAT

```ini
[web]
192.168.1.10
192.168.1.11

[db]
192.168.1.20

[all:vars]
ansible_user=ec2-user
ansible_ssh_private_key_file=key.pem


Key Points

Hosts are grouped using square brackets [group_name]

IP addresses or hostnames are listed under groups

Variables can be defined globally using all:vars

### STATIC INVENTORY – YAML FORMAT

all:
  children:
    web:
      hosts:
        web1:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.10
        web2:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.11
    db:
      hosts:
        db1:
          ansible_host: 192.168.1.20
  vars:
    ansible_user: ec2-user
    ansible_ssh_private_key_file: key.pem

DYNAMIC INVENTORY

Dynamic inventory is used when servers are created and destroyed frequently, especially in cloud platforms like AWS.

Instead of maintaining a manual list:

Ansible automatically fetches host information

Uses inventory plugins or scripts

Best suited for:

Cloud environments

Auto-scaling setups

WHY INVENTORY IS IMPORTANT

Defines which machines Ansible controls

Organizes hosts into logical groups

Stores connection and authentication details

Enables scalable automation

BEST PRACTICES

Use groups instead of single hosts

Store secrets securely using Ansible Vault

Use YAML for complex inventories

Prefer dynamic inventory for cloud environments
